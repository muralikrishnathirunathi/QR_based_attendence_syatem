# QR_based_attendence_syatem
Attendance process in a university’s event is time
consuming and tracking the attendance can be harder. In this
paper, a smart event attendance system for a university using QR
code and GPS technology is proposed with objective to speed up
the process of taking students’ attendance and tracking full
attendance. The method of developing the system is based on two
views; user view which is the mobile application used by the
students, and admin view which is the web administration system
used by the event organizer. From the evaluation, students’
attendance can be traced from the GPS location combine with
QR code. The results indicate that full attendance increases as
the system validates attendance through users’ identification,
location and timestamp during user login and logout. The
proposed system contributes to high satisfaction among the users
that claim that the mobile application helps to speed up the event
registration process.
